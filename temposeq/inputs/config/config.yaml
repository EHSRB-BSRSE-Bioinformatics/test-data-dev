###### DESeq2 parameters
DESeq2:

  intgroup_to_plot: ["group"] # for PCA plots, add tabs for one or more groups to color
  formula_override: null # e.g., "~batch + condition", to enable users to specify the DESeq2 formula to use
  deseq_facet: "chemical"       # If you have many different experimental groups, you may subset the report by specifying a column in the metadata to filter groups, and then setting the group of interest in group_filter
  group_filter:  null        # Which group will this report be done on?
  reports_facet: "chemical" #  
  display_group_filter:  null # 
  sortcol: "dose"                # Optionally, a column by which to sort the contrasts
  lenient_contrasts: FALSE         # Use either column (exp, cont) of contrasts file to limit what is included in the report (instead of just exp column)
  strict_contrasts: FALSE         # Use BOTH columns (exp, cont) of contrasts file to limit what is included in the report
  exclude_samples: null      # Optionally, a vector of sample names to exclude from the analysis
  exclude_groups: null       # Optionally, a vector of groups to exclude from the analysis. By default this is assumed to be in the column specified by params$design.
  include_only_column:  null # Restrict analysis to group(s) in the column listed here based on params$include_only_group.
  include_only_group:  null  # Restrict analysis to this/these group(s) within the column listed in params$include_only_column
